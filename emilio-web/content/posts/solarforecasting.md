### Solar Forecasting

We have created a deep-learning model for solar irradiance forecasting. According to the literature, the hybrid model of CNN-LSTM offers the best results, therefore, we implemented this combination, and we were able to produce predictions from 15 min up to 1 hour. Further details are on GitHub.

### Contributions ðŸ’ª

- *Feature analysis*
    - Solar Azimuth and Solar Zenith features analysis
- Model development
    - I helped along with other colleagues to create and develop the model
    - We have a hybrid model of CNN-LSTM running on the Google Cloud Platform - Cloud Storage.

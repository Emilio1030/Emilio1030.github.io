I’m an actuary with solid experience in Solvency II, IFRS 17, modelling and developing Data Science projects.

I’m passionate about growing into a skilled Data Scientist, aiming to connect actuarial expertise with data-driven solutions.

I currently work as an actuary at the Insurance and Pension Funds Supervisory Authority of Portugal (ASF). Over the years, I’ve had the chance to work on a wide range of actuarial projects—from modeling cash flows for Pension Funds to conducting an IFRS 17 impact study in Portugal. These experiences have deepened my industry knowledge and allowed me deliver accurate and well-communicated solutions.

Improving my communication skills is also a key goal for me, and I’ve been actively working on it.

I’ve been working on personal projects, which you can check out in the Projects section of this webpage. These include Deep Learning and Machine Learning models, as well as two LLM projects targed to increase my dailyt efficiency at work. This year, I plan to focus on developing more Data Science projects about the actuarial field.

Away from desk, I enjoy reading (check out my Goodreads page! [here](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/185718623-emilio-aguiar)) and hitting the gym.
